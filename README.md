# anime_genre_analyzer
This compares the number of anime released per genre in a given year (so in a way you'll know which genre was popular during that year). This reflects data by anichart.net, gathered from 1995 to 2016. This is purely for educational purposes only and is not meant make you realize, indirectly, that your favorite genre may somewhat slightly suck.
